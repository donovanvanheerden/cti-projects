								<h2 id="Luggage">What to do if your baggage is delayed or missing?</h2>
								<div class="Supp_Info-T">
								<p>
									If we misplace or lose your baggage, <strong>we will make every
									effort to return it to you as soon as possible.</strong>
								</p>
								<h2>Finding delayed and lost baggage</h2>
								<p>	The sooner you report a problem to us, the quicker we can resolve it.
									<strong>That's why if your bags have not arrived on time, it's really important that you tell us about it.</strong>
									</br></br>
									If you reported a problem with your <strong>baggage</strong> at the airport and have a <strong>baggage
									file reference number</strong> you do not need to take any further action.</br> <span style="color:#898989">(A baggage
									file reference number is a series of five letters and five numbers such as 
									<strong>FGKZA92648</strong> and is different to the baggage receipt you were given when checking your bags in.)</span></br></br>
									</br>
									If you left the airport without reporting your problem and do not have a baggage file reference 
									number please take the following steps:</br></p>
									<ul>
									<li>Tell us about your delayed baggage.<strong>(describe it. ie. colour, size, distinct markings?, etc...)</strong>.</li>
									<li>If you were travelling to the <strong>Intergalactic Islands</strong> from outside of the <strong>Nova-Roost Continent</strong>, call the AMA-Zing Airways
									Baggage Support Line on <strong>055-02941-9183-285</strong>.</li>
									</ul>
									<p><strong>
									As soon as we find your bag we will return it to you for free to any address you choose.</strong> (This service
									is not available in some countries due to local government restrictions but we will advise you if this applies.)
								</p>
								<h2>Claiming for lost baggage, damaged baggage and damaged and missing contents</h2>
								
									<p>Before making a claim, <strong>please ensure you have told us about your damage or loss and have
									a reference number (e.g. the baggage file reference number from a delayed bag report):</strong>
									</br></br>
									<a id="SubmitR" href="#">If you haven't already done so, report your problem now</a>
									</br></br>
									If you believe you have lost contents or had contents damaged during a baggage inspection
									you can claim compensation directly from the AMA-Zing Transport Security Administration (ATSA):
									</br></br>
									<a id="ClaimForm" href="#">ATSA claim form</a>
									</br></br>
									A personal travel insurance policy will likely provide a greater level of cover than we can
									offer. We therefore recommend that you contact your insurer before making a claim directly 
									with us. We will provide you with a written report, on request, to send to your insurer as 
									proof of loss, damage or delay to your baggage, in support of your claim.
									</br></br>
									If you do not have travel insurance that covers you for any relevant loss, you may claim from
									us for the following reasons within the set deadlines:
